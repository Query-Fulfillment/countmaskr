Description: This is an R package designed to address patient privacy
    concerns by automating the masking of cell counts in aggregated
    tabular reports.  This user-friendly and versatile tool applies
    threshold-based masking to primary, secondary, and tertiary cells,
    replacing true counts with masked values.  It can handle various
    report types, saving significant time and reducing privacy risks.
    This package ensures the protection of patient data while retaining
    accurate counts in complex tabular reports, making it a valuable
    addition to data sharing and privacy protection workflows.
