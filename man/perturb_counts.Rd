\title{Function to perturb counts in a vector with small cells}
\usage{
perturb_counts(x, threshold = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector of length N}

\item{threshold}{threshold for small cell aka 'primary cell'}
}
\value{
a vector with added weighted noise to the non-primary cells
If the non-secondary cell do not have enough room to distribute noise, the function will return with an error
suggesting to use Threshold-based suppression.
}
\description{
This is a function to perturb counts in a vector where only one primary cell is present and requires
secondary cell to be masked.
