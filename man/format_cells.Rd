\title{Format Numeric Values with Thousands Separator}
\usage{
format_cells(values)
}
\arguments{
\item{values}{A numeric vector of values to be formatted. \code{NA} values in the vector
are handled and returned as \code{NA_character_} to maintain compatibility with
formatted output.}
}
\value{
A character vector of formatted values. Each value is represented with commas
as thousands separators (e.g., \code{"1,000"}), and no scientific notation is used.
\code{NA} values are returned as \code{NA_character_}.
}
\description{
Applies comma-based thousands separators to a vector of numeric values, omitting
scientific notation and treating \code{NA} values appropriately. This function is useful
for improving readability of large numbers in tables and data frames.
}
\details{
This function processes each element in the \code{values} vector individually.
Non-\code{NA} values are formatted as strings with comma separators for thousands,
and spaces are removed to prevent unintended whitespace. \code{NA} values are
preserved and returned as \code{NA_character_} to ensure compatibility with
tabular data that may require formatted numeric outputs alongside missing data.
